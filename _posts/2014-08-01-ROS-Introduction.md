title: ROS Introduction

What is ROS:

Ros is an open-source meta operating system
Current stable distributions of ROS: Hydro Medusa

Key Features:

- Hardware abstraction and low level control
- Message passing between process
- OS independent: 
- Ubuntu Linux (Native support)
- Windows, Mac OSX (Experimental)
- Programming language independence
  - C++
  - Python 2 (Hydro) & Python 3 (Indigo)
- Implementation of wide range of commonly used algorithm

- Standardized package management
- Catkin (Standard recommended)
- Rosbuild (retired / Not used in hydro or indigo)
- Useful set of shell commends and utililities
- Tab Completition!!!


Distribution:

ROS is structured as a peer-to-peer network of processes called Nodes Loosely coupled at runtime and
can share messages at runtime using:

- Synchronous RPC communication 
- ROS Services
- Asynchronous data streaming communication
- ROS Topics
- Store Data 
- ROS parameter server

Libraries Support:

- Main supported Client Libraries
  - Python 2 & 3
  - C++
  - Lisp

- Experimental
  - Java (Supports android)
  - Lua
  - R


Sensors IO:

- 1D / 2D / and 3D range finders
  - e.g. Microsoft Kinect
- Cameras
- Mono and Stereo
- USB and Firewire
- Streaming video (gstreamer)
- Force / Torque / and Touch 
- Motion Capture
- Pose estimation (gps and IMU)
- Audio and speech recognition
- RFID
- Sensor and Actuator interface
  - e.g.  Arduino, Lego NXT
- And more
