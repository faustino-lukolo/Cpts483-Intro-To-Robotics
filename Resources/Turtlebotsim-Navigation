TO RUN Example Maps
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch


Make a Map
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_playground.launch

You can customize your simulated TurtleBot by setting TURTLEBOT_XXX environment variables; for example:


$ export TURTLEBOT_BASE=create
$ export TURTLEBOT_STACKS=circles
$ export TURTLEBOT_3D_SENSOR=asus_xtion_pro
$ roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_playground.launch

To start map building, type:
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo gmapping_demo.launch


Use RViz to visualize the map building process:
$ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch

Finally, save the map to disk:
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f /Cpts483-Intro-To-Robotics/Maps/<mymap name>


Navigate the playground:
To be sure that all will run as expected, kill all you launched in the previous section and repeat all steps except the map building. Instead, type:

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch map_file:=<full path to your map file>

Or if you prefer to use an already created map, just omit the map_file argument.
Now you can send the robot anywhere in the playground with RViz, same way as explained on navigate a map tutorial.
