Stage:

Stage is an Open-Source 2D simulator for multiple (large scale) mobile robots.

    Models:

        - Sensors (e.g. Laser, Sonarâ€¦)
        - Actuators (e.g. gripper)
        - Simple objects for manipulation
        - No physics model

Webots:

Webots is a development environment used to program and simulate robots

    Advantages:
    
    	- Complex and realistic 3D simulation of physics / dynamics
    	- Vast Collection of robots, sensors, and models
    	- Vast Library of indoor and outdoor objects

	Disadvantage:
	    - Cross-platform, but propitiatory (and very expensive)
