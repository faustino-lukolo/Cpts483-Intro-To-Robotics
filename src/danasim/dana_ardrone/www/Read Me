In-Browser AR.Drone Control through rosbridge
The following assumes roscore and ardrone_autonomy (described above) are still running.

Install rosbridge and mjpeg-server:
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-rosbridge-suite
sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-mjpeg-server

This will allow this web page to be served using roswww:
cd ~/ros/drone_teleop
mkdir www
cd www

wget https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14391589/tutorial/rosbridge_ardrone/drone_browser_teleop.html
wget https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14391589/tutorial/rosbridge_ardrone/ros.js

As an alternative, you can also clone this web interface and another interface with buttons from this github repository.

Run rosbridge, mjpeg_server, and roswww:
rosrun rosbridge_server rosbridge.py
rosrun mjpeg_server mjpeg_server
rosrun roswww webserver.py

Navigate a websocket-enabled browser to http://localhost:8000/drone_teleop/drone_browser_teleop.html

If successful, you browser should look like the following image, with a live video stream from the drone's front camera. You should now be able to takeoff, drive, and land the drone through the in-browser instructions.
