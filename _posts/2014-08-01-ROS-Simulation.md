Stage:

Stage is an Open-Source 2D simulator for multiple (large scale) mobile robots.

    Models:
    
    - Sensors (e.g. Laser, Sonarâ€¦)
    - Actuators (e.g. gripper)
    - Simple objects for manipulation
    - No physics model

Webots:

Webots is a development environment used to program and simulate robots

    Advantages:
    
	- Complex and realistic 3D simulation of physics / dynamics
	- Vast Collection of robots, sensors, and models
	- Vast Library of indoor and outdoor objects

	Disadvantage:
    
    - Cross-platform, but propitiatory (and very expensive)

Gazebo:

Gazebo offers the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. 

    Advantages:
        
    - Realistic simulation of
    - Rigid body physics / dynamics (ODE / Bullet)
    - Models for complex robots, actuators and sensors
    - Official simulator of DARPA Robotics Challenge
    - Open-Source and free to the public!!
